        <p>
			When someone tells you they’re going on safari, the default images are of Kruger in South Africa and Kenya, but amongst the travellers in the know, Botswana has quietly built up a reputation as one of the best safari destinations in the world. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So, if you’ve only got time for one safari in 2021, Botswana should be at the top of your list.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is famous for the stunning Okavango Delta, a Unesco World Heritage site known for its sprawling grassy plains, which flood seasonally, transforming the area into a spectacular and lush animal habitat where dugout canoes meander down the waterways past hippos, elephants and crocodiles. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Moremi Game Reserve, which occupies the east and central areas of the region, allow for sightings of some of the mightiest and most impressive of the dry land wildlife including lions, leopards, giraffes and rhinos.
		</p>
		<p>
			What makes Botswana different from its safari counterparts is that there are no fences in sight, allowing the animals roam free. And whilst this may lead to an increased amount of patience required to view your desired animals, the rewards will be miraculous. 
		</p>
		<p>
			What’s more, the time spent waiting for wildlife can provide you with a great excuse for a drink in the mesmeric landscapes of wide-open plains and lush greenery. The combination of surroundings, sightings and the generous and welcoming people of Botswana makes for a safari destination you won’t want to miss.
