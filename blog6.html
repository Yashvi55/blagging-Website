			The rise in popularity of the Adriatic regions of Europe has been widely acknowledged and for years, the default trip was to either Italy or, perhaps more recently, Croatia – with its rich history and stunning Dalmatian coast beaches. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, travellers are starting to realise that maybe there are other wonders to enjoy in the area and that the crowded streets of Dubrovnik can be replaced with something new, but equally as beautiful. Step forward Slovenia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bordering both Italy and Croatia but leading the way in the area with sustainable tourism, Slovenia is now rivalling places like Costa Rica with its green initiatives. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The capital, Ljubljana, is not only a blend of brightly coloured buildings and history, but it’s also known as Europe’s Green Capital. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The rest of the country is visually akin to walking around in a postcard, with snow-capped peaks footed by brilliant turquoise rivers and lakes which are flanked by verdant green fields. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Nowhere is this more evident than Lake Bled, where a picturesque red-topped church sits on a small island in the middle of one of the most peaceful and picturesque bodies of water in Europe.
		</p>
		<p>
			Slovenia has benefitted not only from tourists being pulled north and south to its busier neighbours but also from a boom in the foodie culture within the country, which is placing it front and centre on many gastronomy enthusiasts’ radar.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s not just the views and food that are beckoning visitors from across the globe, Slovenia is home to a raft of activities and unique experiences, none more so than acclaimed Michelin-starred restaurant Pikol’s floating glamping hotel: Pikol Lake Village, located among the vineyards of Vipava Valley, where you can enjoy the best Slovenia has to offer and sleep under the stars to cap it all off.
