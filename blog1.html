           If you’re looking for a slice of relatively undiscovered tropical paradise, look no further than the exquisite Siargao Island in the Philippines. Another coconut palm swathed travel discovery that owes much of its place in our list to the intrepid surfers, who seem to have an unnerving ability to uncover gems across the globe, Siargao is a must for those looking for a slice of heaven on Earth. 
		</p>
		<p>
		   Known as the surfing capital of the Philippines, Siargao was voted Best Island in the World by readers of Conde Nast Traveller magazine in 2019 and for good reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			Home to the aptly named Cloud 9 surf spot, that description could easily be applied to the rest of this visually mesmerising laidback island. 
		</p>
		<p>
			With its pristine white-sand beaches, crystal clear turquoise waters, waterfalls, natural lagoons, caves, and peppered with small, picturesque islands just off its shoreline complete with colourful coral reefs teeming with rainbow sea creatures, Siargao really feels like paradise.
		</p>
		<p>
			While surfers may be thanked for putting Siargao on the travel map, this lovely island also features a host of other delights for all tourists, including world-class snorkelling and diving in the crystal waters and delicious local and international cuisine for every discerning traveller’s palate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The island has more in common with Pulau Merah in Java than the five-star decadence of the Maldives, but there is a stream of cool, independent new hotels and businesses, although, in keeping with the trend du jour, they are working hard to retain a sensitive and sustainable approach. Popular areas include General Luna and Del Carmen which has the beautiful Sugba Lagoon nearby (popular with kayakers and paddleboarders), both showcasing the very best of sustainable tourism.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adventurous travellers will rejoice in casting their eyes across a sea of coconut trees – truly a miraculous sight – and visiting the rock pools at Magpupungko. And if surfing, sailing, kayaking, sightseeing and enjoying local cuisine isn’t enough, for a truly special experience, catch a boat out to the island of Bucas Grande to swim with stingless jellyfish.
