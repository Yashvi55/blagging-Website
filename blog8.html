            Costa Rica has long held a special place in the eco-travellers’ hearts and still commands its place at the top of the pile for a truly breath-taking destination.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the majestic Volcano Arenal set in misty cloud forests overflowing with wildlife to the beautiful palm-fringed beaches with turtles laying eggs to the sounds of macaws and howler monkeys, Costa Rica is a sustainable tourism haven. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Often regarded as one of the ‘greenest’ countries in the world when it comes to tourism, there are very few places where the phrase “leave only footprints” is more applicable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Costa Rica has the wonderful luxury of being flanked by both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, whilst being small enough to allow visitors the opportunity to visit both coasts in one stay without having to take a month off. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The country is home to more than 6% of the world’s biodiversity – a figure that is all the more incredible when you consider that this is more than Europe and the USA combined. 
		</p>
		<p>
			But it is the sensitive and thoughtful manner in which Costa Rica treats this gift that allows the wildlife and land to flourish, with the country on track to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2050 and over 95% of its electricity coming from sustainable sources.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no right or wrong way to ‘do’ Costa Rica, but some of the highlights include the Monteverde Cloud Forest where you can stroll (or zip wire) through the forest on suspended platforms, keeping an eye out for toucans and monkeys. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The awe-inspiring Osa Peninsula, home to Corcovado National Park is one for wildlife lovers too, brimming with tapirs, red-eyed tree frogs, armadillos, kinkajous and the elusive jaguar. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For those who want to experience something truly unique, in the North, you can be welcomed in by Costa Rica’s oldest indigenous tribe, the Maleku, who offer tours and hikes focusing on their way of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s hard to think of a destination that deftly balances luxury, culture and wildlife better than Costa Rica. Almost anything you can imagine is possible here – from kayaking mangroves with caimans, walking in amongst the jungle canopy as sloths dangle down to greet you, to lounging in 5-star resorts on idyllic beaches – there truly is something for everyone.
