        <p>
           Although you may question why such a well-known destination would feature again in a list with the top 10 travel destinations for 2021, there can be no doubt that the beauty and relaxation of the Maldives is more urgently needed than ever before.
		</p>
		<p> 
			After such a tumultuous year, the unique island perfection of the Maldives is one that must be enjoyed to be believed. It is one of the few places on the globe where the multitude of photographs never do it justice – there is simply no place on Earth that is more tranquil and romantic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Maldives is likely once more to claim its crown as the most luxurious escape destination in the world as many travellers seek to escape to paradise. But to pigeon-hole this wondrous Indian Ocean archipelago as a place to simply lie on a sunbed under a palm tree, waiting for cocktails and private dining under the stars will be to do it a disservice. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Maldives has so much more to offer than simply the over-water bungalows and pristine beaches. It’s now firmly planted itself among the world’s premier diving, surfing and paddle-boarding destinations and it’s one of the few places where all ages can snorkel amongst some of the most colourful and magnificent sea creatures – safely and just yards from your resort.
		</p>
		<p>
			The resorts in the Maldives have been fastidious in their COVID-safe travel preparations and the feeling of safety on the islands is all but guaranteed. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There is also a plethora of new luxury resorts opening and many of the existing ones have committed to refurbishments, so you know that the level of quality and service will be second to none. There is also very little more awesome than arriving at your luxury resort in the middle of a clear turquoise ocean by seaplane or boat. Even after all these years, the Maldives still guarantees a simply unforgettable experience.
