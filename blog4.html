            Well known for its major cities like Dubai, the United Arab Emirates was the most searched for destination for 2021, and with good reason. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Naysayers may point to the lack of perceived quiet or exploration, but for those who have been and stepped away from the bright lights of Dubai, there is an abundance of wonders to witness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Made up of seven emirate states, the common selling point is that they all enjoy hour upon hour of winter sun, allowing even the most committed of sunbathers to achieve their perfect bronzed look. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Dubai, by far the most famous destination in the UAE, is notorious for its blend of futuristic, towering skyscrapers, never-ending shopping malls, fringed with miles of sandy beaches, as well as one of the world’s most recognisable buildings – Burj Khalifah.
		</p>
		<p>
			But the popularity of the UAE lies not just in the immaculately conceived city of Dubai. The other six emirates have their own individual charms that deserve the attention of visitors. 
		</p>
		<p>
			What was not so long ago a sea of endless dunes and crumbling ancient forts is now a traveller’s delight. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enjoy a desert safari or visit the wonderful Jebel Jais Mountain range on the passage to Ras Al Khaimah – the northernmost emirate which offers tourists ancient museums, mosques, beautiful coastline and the splendid Dhayah Fort mountaintop. Fujairah also has some incredible snorkelling spots for the more adventurous beachgoers, while for those looking for sanctity and peace, a visit to the breath-taking Sheikh-Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi is a once in a lifetime experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simply put, a visit to the UAE really shouldn’t be limited just to Dubai, there’s a real-world of wonder in this magical desert destination.
