            Although there is often the urge to travel to warmer climes when you’re looking for your next destination, sometimes it is the ones without the guaranteed sunshine that give you the greatest experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Only accessible by ferry, the Isle of Mull is a small island on the Inner Hebrides just off Scotland which offers a truly authentic and invigorating experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The island itself comprises some of the most varied and stunning scenery in the whole of Scotland. With the central Monroe, Ben More and its craggy ridges in the mid-west of the island towering over winding coastal roads edged with thick kelp where you can spot seals, otters and a vast array of birds, the island offers so much considering its small landmass. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For fans of walking and those who seek rugged adventure, there’s stunning waterfall scrambles, kayaking, boating, wild-swimming in lochs – all in the shadows of ancient castles and white-sand beaches that wouldn’t be out of place in the Caribbean.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite its small population, Mull has a truly welcoming and bustling feel in the small enclaves of villages. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The island’s colourful capital, Tobermory, is where local fishermen continue to ply their trade and local whisky distilleries and smokehouses produce some fine drink and cuisine for weary explorers fresh from a day out at sea, whale-watching or visiting the ancient and beautiful isle of Iona just off the southern tip of the island.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mull feels like a trip back in time, before buildings stretched to the sky, and the world felt so crowded. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s a place where eagles soar in the sky and the rugged wilderness feels like it could reclaim the island for itself at any time.
