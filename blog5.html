           If there’s one group of travellers who seem to be able to pick phenomenal destinations time after time in pursuit of their hobby, it’s surfers. 
		</p>
		<p>
		   Among some of the places they can lay claim to putting on the travel map include Fiji, Tahiti, Costa Rica, Hawaii and of course, Indonesia, which has long been a mecca for surfers. 
		</p>
		<p>
		   Although surfers hunt the remote, empty, tropical waves and long to remain off the beaten track, they also have a knack of discovering some of the most beautiful destinations in the world, and not just for surfing. 
		</p>
		<p>
		   It seems that where surfers go, one of the best eco-tourism follows, and this is the case with the stunning island of Pulau Merah – or the Red Island as it’s affectionately known. 
		</p>
		<p>
		   Fringed with deserted idyllic stretches of sandy beaches and tropical reefs with the Javan Jungle spilling onto its shores, the island resembles true paradise.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the destination for the more intrepid traveller who is more at home in a rustic home-stay than a five-star resort, but some boutique hotels are starting to appear. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The fishing village of Pancer is a great base to submerge yourself in the local Javan way of life. And it’s not just beaches and the waves that make this such a unique and special destination either. There’s an abundance of Indonesian culture to enjoy – whether it’s hiking to the hidden waterfalls and beauty spots, or indulging your soul with a visit to the beautiful Pura Tawang Alun temple. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We’d recommend Pulau Merah before everyone else does.
